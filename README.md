# P20-DOM-Links-Collection
Module 12 Class Activity (DOM links Collection)

Preface
The Document Object Model (DOM) contains several collections, which are groups of related objects on a page. DOM collections are accessed as properties of DOM objects such as the document object or a DOM node. The document object has properties containing the:

images collection
links collection
forms collection
anchors collection
These collections contain all the elements of the corresponding type on the page. The example of Figs. 12.12 - 12.14 uses the links collection to extract all the links on a page and display them at the bottom of the page.
